# Marvel-Us History
A Marvel character database

## Purpose
Marvel has been around since 1939(Formerly known as Timely Comics). Since then a universe of characters were created each with its own comic book series and offshoots of series or movies with storylines that change whenever the franchise is bought or the studio decides to go in a different direction. With so many changes made within the Marvel comic book world and in theaters, it can be a challenge to keep track of the character's story. Our app helps address that issue. 

* Our app allows the user to make a search for the comic book character and read about their past and present
* If you're a movie-goer and you want to know what the latest Marvels are all about? Our app has links to get you up to date.
