# Marvel-Us History
A Marvel character database

## Purpose
Marvel has been around since 1939(Formerly known as Timely Comics). Since then a universe of characters were created each with its own comic book series and offshoots of series or movies with storylines that change whenever the franchise is bought or the studio decides to go in a different direction. With so many changes made within the Marvel comic book world and in theaters, it can be a challenge to keep track of the character's story. Our app helps address that issue. Our database allow the user to search for 


Mígreni seeks to address those issues

With Mígreni, users can create a unique account, log in, and be presented with the user page. From here, the user can log a new migraine and be asked questions about their migraine. After submitting these questions, users can click on the journal to see previous migraines with associated data. Then users can update or delete a migraine. Users can also see a line chart of their previous migraines where intensities are graphed accordingly by date. Finally, users can logout and create a new account if needs be.
